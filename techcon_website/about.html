      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>TechCon began in 2010 as a small grassroots event hosted by a group of technology enthusiasts in San Francisco. Originally conceived as a one-day meetup to share ideas about web development, the event quickly gained traction within the tech community. The enthusiasm and demand for deeper discussions around innovation, design, and scalability led organizers to expand the format into a full-blown multi-day conference.</p>
      <p>By 2013, TechCon had moved into larger venues, attracting hundreds of developers, engineers, and tech leaders from across the country. The event started to feature keynote speakers, sponsor showcases, and themed breakout sessions that focused on emerging technologies like cloud computing, mobile development, and cybersecurity.</p>
      <p>Over the next decade, TechCon evolved into an internationally recognized event. It now hosts over 5,000 attendees annually and includes workshops, live demos, hackathons, and networking opportunities. It has become a launchpad for startups, a hub for research-driven presentations, and a place where aspiring and seasoned professionals come together to shape the future of technology.</p>
