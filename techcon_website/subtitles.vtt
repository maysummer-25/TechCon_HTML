00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.200
hi guys I'm Robert mauy I am GP of La

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.200
fund so we invest into graduate students

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.200
at UCLA and in the West LA region and we

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.200
help build community around the Venture

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.200
ecosystem up there uh check us out at

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.200
Los angeles. org and Robert going up the

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.200
coast uh in your re up in La uh how does

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.200
I know you're very involved in UCLA and

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.200
you fund entrepreneurs that come out of

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.200
UCLA students from UCLA but how is our

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.200
schools like UCLA and the USC's uh how

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.200
are they supporting The Innovation

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.200
economy whether the through the tech

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.200
transfer office or or otherwise many

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.200
have a lot of programs on campus Chief

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.200
among them usually an accelerator

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.200
program um on UCLA's campus Black Rock

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.200
has a Launchpad and you have essentially

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.200
community and infinity groups that are

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.200
doubling down on most of the time where

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.200
they went to school so Larry thinkink

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.200
went to UCLA and the programs that are

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.200
active on campus usually have some sort

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.200
of touch point with an alumni and on the

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.200
Venture side I'm finding that it's

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.200
really the Affinity groups that are

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.200
wanting to invest back into LA because

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.200
they can see the impact and in this

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.200
interest rate environment where people

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.200
are wanting a multiple on treasuries if

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.200
it doesn't have some sort of impact

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.200
element to it given how few of these

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.200
Venture funds that are actually doing

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.200
exactly that then there's a real problem

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.200
so the universities leading with these

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.200
corporate Partnerships that are driving

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.200
a lot of the resources has been been a

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.200
real Boon for these students um the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.200
accelerator programs will pair them with

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.200
mentors that you can't buy these

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.200
people's time so that's been a real

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.200
accelerant for some of the people that

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.200
I've seen do a lot with the resources

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.200
that are made available to

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.200
them and and Robert what role are the

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.200
VCS and the angel investors playing

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.200
currently in continuing to build this

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.200
Innovation economy and and obviously

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.200
fund this Innovation economy trying to

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.200
deth thought essentially the

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.200
Capital freeze that's out there and a

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.200
lot of that continues to persist so I

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.200
really feel like my role at least in Los

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.200
Angeles ecosystem is connecting the

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.200
ready sources of capital that are

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.200
straight down the line looking for

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.200
something with the deals that are doing

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.200
exactly that and when you're building a

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.200
company you don't have the perspective

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.200
to know who to approach or really the

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.200
time for that matter so I love how the

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.200
university resources is really doing

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.200
even a better job than the venture

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.200
capitalist at bringing these people

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.200
together and so I'm really encouraged to

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.200
see how the university either

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.200
accelerators or these launch pads are

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.200
providing the nexuses where there's

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.200
events where people can connect and not

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.200
having to have a go through a go between

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.200
like myself and I think that's the

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.200
future is like providing some sort of

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.200
place where people that are building in

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.200
ecosystems are connecting with funders

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.200
and it all organically can close you

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.200
know in real time
